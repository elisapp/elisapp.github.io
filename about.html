Elisa first discovered her love for music at the tender age of 5 years old when she was still residing in her home country,
Dominican Republic. She is the daughter of one of the most successful female comedians and her father is a news anchor. 
Due to her parents' occupations, Elisa has always been surrounded with lights, cameras, and art. As a child, musical icons 
such as Destiny’s Child, Juan Luis Guerra, Sadè and the late Michael Jackson inspired her. At age 13 she relocated to Florida 
where she began to explore her passion for music through writing, dance and musical instruments. She began to teach herself to 
play guitar, which suddenly allowed her to compose her own songs and experiment with her melodic, soothing and soulful voice.
With her eclectic style, a mixture of Acoustics, Pop/R&B and Caribbean-Dance flavour that can be heard in her music, she brings 
a fresh new sound. The multi-talented songstress is currently working with Grammy Award winning producer, Troyton Rami, who has
produced and collaborated with Sean Paul, Elephant Man, Rudy Perez, Tego Calderòn, Busta Rhymes, etc., on perfecting her natural 
born talent. Elisa is currently collaborating with Ten-Time Grammy nominated Reggae band –Third World, on a track entitled Looking for Something.
