<h1>Elisa Polanco</h1>
<body>

<br>
Elisa first discovered her love for music at the tender age of 5 years old when she was still residing in her home country,
<br>Dominican Republic. She is the daughter of one of the most successful female comedians and her father is a news anchor. 
<br>Due to her parents' occupations, Elisa has always been surrounded with lights, cameras, and art. As a child, musical icons 
<br>such as Destiny’s Child, Juan Luis Guerra, Sadè and the late Michael Jackson inspired her. At age 13 she relocated to Florida 
<br>where she began to explore her passion for music through writing, dance and musical instruments. She began to teach herself to 
<br>play guitar, which suddenly allowed her to compose her own songs and experiment with her melodic, soothing and soulful voice.
<br>With her eclectic style, a mixture of Acoustics, Pop/R&B and Caribbean-Dance flavour that can be heard in her music, she brings 
<br>a fresh new sound. The multi-talented songstress is currently working with Grammy Award winning producer, Troyton Rami, who has
<br>produced and collaborated with Sean Paul, Elephant Man, Rudy Perez, Tego Calderòn, Busta Rhymes, etc., on perfecting her natural 
<br>born talent. Elisa is currently collaborating with Ten-Time Grammy nominated Reggae band –Third World, on a track entitled Looking for Something.
